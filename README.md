# Simple Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of a linear regression model without relying on any external libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. This model is built from scratch using basic mathematical operations and is intended to serve as a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of linear regression.

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is a basic statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a simple linear regression model can be implemented without relying on external libraries. By understanding the underlying mathematics and principles, users can gain insights into how machine learning algorithms work at a fundamental level.

Atlast I have also implemented the same using sklearn library.

Thank you.
